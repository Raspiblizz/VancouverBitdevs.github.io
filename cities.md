Bitcoin is a global phenomenon that appears differently depending on the lens it is viewed through. Each community provides its own unique lens, and to study Bitcoin means not only to carefully examine it, but also to change your angle, consider new aspects and most importantly, be humble and curious.

BitDevs, short for Bitcoin Developers, is a series of in-person seminars dedicated to the study of Bitcoin. It was pioneered in New York based on the ancient Socratic Seminar methodology of pursuing truth through examination and debate. At BitDevs, we present various technical (including economic, social and philosophical) aspects and put them up for discussion, complimented with further reading material.

This format has since spread all around the world, including Vancouver. We encourage you to seek out other BitDevs communities, like the ones listed below. We further encourage you to start your own, beginning either by forking [the original project](https://github.com/BitDevsNYC/BitDevsNYC.github.io/) or [our own](https://github.com/VancouverBitdevs/VancouverBitdevs.github.io).
